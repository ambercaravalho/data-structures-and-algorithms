# Data Structures and Algorithms (Projects)
This repository contains all the code from the Data Structures and Algorithms course taken at The University of Arizona Global Campus. This course teaches the foundational concepts and features of object-oriented programming, as well as the different data structures and algorithms used in computer science.
## Course Description
In this course, students learn about data structure foundations, including arrays, stacks, queues, lists, and trees. The course emphasizes the appropriate use and choice of standard data structures, as well as the analysis of different sorting and searching algorithms. All course materials and assignments were completed using Java.
## Course Contents
The repository contains code examples and projects for each week of the course (week one through week five). The examples are organized into folders for each week, with each folder containing all completed projects from those weeks.
## Getting Started
To run any of the code in this repository, you will need to have a Java development environment set up on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/.
