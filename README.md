# Data Structures and Algorithms (Projects)
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains all the code from the Data Structures and Algorithms course taken at The University of Arizona Global Campus. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of foundational concepts and features of object-oriented programming, along with a deep dive into various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Course Description
The Data Structures and Algorithms course focuses on developing a strong foundation in data structures. Students gain knowledge about fundamental data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, lists, and trees. The course emphasizes the importance of selecting and utilizing appropriate standard data structures, as well as analyzing and implementing different sorting and searching algorithms. All course materials and assignments were completed using Java, a powerful programming language for implementing these concepts.

## Course Contents
This repository contains code examples and projects for each week of the course, spanning from week one through week five. The examples are organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific week and containing all the completed projects from that particular week. This structured organization allows for easy navigation and exploration of the course content.
